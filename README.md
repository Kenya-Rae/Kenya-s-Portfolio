## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The primary goal of this protfolio Project is to showcase myself to potential recruiters that are looking to hire. This project has two target audiences: Recruiters and anyone who is interested in common interest.

#### Recruiters Goals

The main audience for this site is recruiters.

#### Recruiters Goals:

- Consider hiring applicant(s).
- Look for qualified applicant(s).
- Improve the quality of hires.
- Enhancing employer brand.

#### Developers goals:
- Showcase myself in the best light to recruiters.
- To get hired.
- Create an simple and effective website.

#### User Stories

As a recruiter I want:

- The ability to easily navigate the site (portfolio).
- Be able to see experience and skills demonstrated.
- Access to CV.
- Able to contact you. 

As the site owner I want:

- To get hired.
- Find others of similar interest.
- Collaborate with others.

## Design Choices

The overall feel of this site is to be minimalistic and professional. The design choices below were planned with this in mind.

### Fonts

- The primary font *Roboto* was choosen due to how concise the letters are. This font will be used within the text content of the site.
- The secondary font *Cormorant Garamond* was choosen for its simple and modern letters. Which will be used within the headers.

### Icons 

- All icons used as they are easily recognised and understood by everyone.

### Colours

- I used a dark background to light navagation/footer, as the contrast and the feel of the page looks more formal. I chose to use light text and colorful elements to brighten pages up through out the website to ensure the website doesn't look flat all the way through.

## Features

- Fully functional navigation and footer, no collapse element was used as this made some smaller devices look empty.
- Favicon was created and used to personalise the site, this is a simple icon that can be recognised.
- Responsive on all screen sizes. 
- Easy naviagation, intuitivity using easily identified icons.
- Simple introduction within the home page.
- About me page contains brief information regarding myself (site owner). An accordion was choosen to display this information on smaller devices as this makes the site less busy and more neat. Users can interact with the accordion allowing them to read a section at a time instead of all the information showing at once. As screen size increases accordion is no longer displayed and all information is provided on the screen without any interaction features.
- The CV page provides a breakdown of my working cv and my email. Where users can gain quick information about my working history or to contact me directly. A downloadable link of my CV is provided within the navbar for easy and quick access.
- The portfolio page showcases my personal hobbies gardening, gaming and my web development projects. Users can interact with two videos that highlights recent edits and have the option to control them. As well as an carousel that displays photos of my gardening hobby.
- Footer is responsive and provides links to social medias.

### Accessibiilty
- Ensuring that design/layout was not complex but was consistent and easy to naviagate.
- Descriptive alt tags for each item.
- Using aria labels when needed.
- Used semantic HTML to define meaning of the content.

## Testing

## Bugs

- When viewing on a mobile device with 320 x 480 resolution, text boxes overlapped and dragged down the page. I made a change to the max height of the body and made changes to each indivdual component and adjusted accordingly to resolutions.
- Fatal error when pushing my commits to my repository. Due to file sizing, I had to resize/compress my files in to smaller files to fit the capcity of GitHub.
- Carousel images where taking up a lot of space within the larger screen views. As well as this, changing the size made the postioning of the photo allign to the left. Leaving a big amount of space on the right. Removing .w-100 from the class element allowed me to size the images according to screen size. Using media-queries. 
- Footer wasnt staying in postion and content meet with the footer once placed at the bottom. I had used sticky element and some styling to position my footer correctly. I provided some elements with a margin bottom to push up the content away from the footer.
- Styling for media queries that where 1440px and up, I was unable position my divs horizontally. I had used margin-left to move and position them to where I need. Though this may not be beneficial for xxx-large screens as this may change the postioning on different screens.
